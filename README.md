\# WFSL File Guard



Deterministic file integrity and boundary guard for WFSL systems.



WFSL File Guard enforces explicit control over file access, mutation, and integrity within WFSL-managed environments. It ensures that all file interactions comply with declared governance rules and verifiable integrity constraints.



All decisions are deterministic and derived from declared configuration and verified file state.



\## Capabilities

\- Deterministic file admission and integrity validation

\- Enforcement of explicit file access boundaries

\- Verification of file hashes and structural invariants

\- Structured outputs for audit and governance

\- Integration with WFSL verification and control-plane systems



\## Scope

WFSL File Guard operates strictly at the file boundary.

It does not execute application logic or perform business processing.



This component ensures file-level integrity and governance across WFSL systems.



\## Intended users

\- WFSL core systems

\- Licensed WFSL services

\- Internal file governance, audit, and verification pipelines



This component is not intended for end users or standalone deployment outside the WFSL ecosystem.
